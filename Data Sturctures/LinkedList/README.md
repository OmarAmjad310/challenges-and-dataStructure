# Linked-List Implementaion
In this challage we tried to do some functions with linkedlist Data-sturcture and how to deal with it and below we can find the functions.

# Add Function:
In this function we built a it to add a node in linkedlist.

# Include Function:
In this function we built a it to search for node in linkedlist.

# Remove Function:
In this function we built a it to remove a Node by Value in linkedlist.

# Insert Function:
In this function we built a it to insert a Node in linkedlist.

# Print Function : 
In this function we built a it to see the results for all functions in the linkedlist.

# Outputs with Edgecases:
In this photo we will see the outputs for all functions and edge cases that used.
