# Linked-List Implementaion
In this challage we tried to do some functions with linedlist Data-sturcture and how to deal with it and below we can find the functions.

# Add and Print Function:
In this function we built a function to add and print the data.

# Outputs with Edgecases:
In this photo we will see the outputs for all functions and edge cases that used.
